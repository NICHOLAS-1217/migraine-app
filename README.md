# Migraine Daily Tracker
The Migraine Management System Software is designed to cater to the diverse needs of patients, caretakers, and administrators by providing a comprehensive suite of functionalities. User registration and management form the initial entry point, allowing individuals and caretakers to register on the platform and admins to efficiently manage user accounts. Patients utilize the system's primary feature, Migraine Tracking, to log detailed information about each migraine episode, severity, symptoms, and duration. Caretakers, a crucial support system, benefit from a dedicated communication channel that enables them to view patientâ€™s data,  updates regarding the patient's migraine status and receive alerts for critical events. Admin is able to manage the user account, system maintenance and view the migraine data and profile of every patient. The system will also provide emergency numbers, a list of clinics and doctors available for consultation and a board with general advice to deal with migraines. This high-level functionality is encapsulated within a well-defined system architecture that considers the interplay of patients, caretakers, admins, and the underlying system components. Together, these features make the Migraine Management System a powerful tool for comprehensive and proactive migraine care. Our system here to help users to better monitor and treat their lifestyles to reduce the probability of migraine.
